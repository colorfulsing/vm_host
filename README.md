# Fedora 33 as host

## Shared directories

### Host steps

Create a directory to share stuff within the virtual machines:

```bash
mkdir -p /vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir
```

Now add SELinux file type label to allow `virt-manager` to access and mount it:


```bash
# Add virt_home_t context type to the shared directory permanently.
semanage fcontext -a -t virt_home_t "/vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir(/*)?"

# Apply the new context policy to the shared directory.
restorecon -R /vm_shared/kernel_build
```

Repeat to add any new shared directories.

Now add the new filesystem hardware into the virtual machine by clicking on `+ Add Hardware` button:

You can set ``Export filesystem as readonly mount` option to make it read only.

### Guest steps

Create the target directory into the guest VM, for simplicity, we will use the same `/vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir
```

Temporarily mount the shared directory on the guest VM:

```bash
# Replace `<vm_target>` with whatever you set on the VM's hardware `Target path`.
# Replace `<guest_target>` with whatever guest directory you want to mount it.
# mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L <vm_target> <guest_target>

sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L /vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir /vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir
```

You can also modify `/etc/fstab` file to make it permanently, to do this, just add the following:

```bash
# Set `fsck_order` to 0 to disable it (recommended).
# <vm_target> <guest_target> <type> <options> <dump_frequency> <fsck_order>
/vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir /vm_shared/my_vm_shared_dir 9p trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L 0 0
```

And then apply all mounts described on `/etc/fstab` like this:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

And done, now you can share your files between your Host and Guest VM.
